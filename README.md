# Home Assistant dashboard demo
Quite a few people wanted me to share so let's go! This a dashboard I use on every device. Top one with green theme is as viewed on my computer screen. Second one in landscape below is a tablet which I've mounted on the wall. Third - two portrait screenshots taken from my phone.

First column is alerts, followed by lights and LED strips, media players (not visible on tablet), then controls (not visible on tablet) for fan, purifier and humidifier
Second column is second part of alerts. Then you've got temperature and humidity indoors and outdoors which is averaged out of indoor and outdoor sensors respectively. Then you've got a little graph with temps in the fridge and the freezer followed by power draw of plant lighting and my proxmox hyperconverged cluster. The bottom half of this column is not visible on tablet and contains tabbed weather with hourly and daily forecasts and 24 hour graph of atmospheric pressure sensor.
Third column is temperature reading of every indoor (first graph) sensor and outdoor ones (second graph). Then you've got statuses of door, window and presence sensors which update live and change colors of respective icons etc.
Fourth column is humidity reading of every indoor (first graph) sensor and outdoor ones (second graph). Then it is followed by most important VM and container statuses from my proxmox cluster, status and speed of torrents and a temporary card for adjusting microphone for local assist pipeline.
